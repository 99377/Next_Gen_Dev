# ChatBot with Rule-Based Responses

This is a simple chatbot implemented in Python that provides responses based on predefined rules and probabilities of recognized words in user input.

## Overview

The chatbot analyzes user input and matches it against a set of predefined responses. It calculates the probability of recognized words in the user message and determines the best-matching response based on these probabilities. If no sufficiently probable response is found, it defaults to a generic unknown response.

## Features

- Responds to common greetings like 'hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'sup', 'heyo'.
- Recognizes farewells such as 'bye' and 'goodbye'.
- Answers queries about its well-being ('how are you doing?').
- Expresses gratitude ('thank you', 'thanks') and acknowledges appreciation.
- Provides longer responses for specific queries like advice and eating habits.

## Getting Started

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Ensure the `re` module is available (usually included in Python's standard library).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd chatbot
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the chatbot by running `chatbot.py`.
2. Enter your message when prompted.
3. The bot will respond based on the rules defined in `chatbot.py`.

## Customization
